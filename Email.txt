Move your mouse to the right of the VRDB.zip entry and click on the menu (three dots); then select "Download".  Note into which folder it is downloaded; you will need to know this for installing the program.

It is important that you follow each step in the attached "Installation.pdf".  Bypassing any step can lead to problems in installing and/or using the program.  Support will be limited if you have not followed each step.

If you encounter issues during installation, you should review the information in the "Installation.pdf", "Instructions.pdf", and "FAQ.pdf" found within the archive VRDB.zip before contacting support.
