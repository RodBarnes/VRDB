# What is VRDB? #
VRDB is the “Voter Registration DataBase” which relies upon public data from Washington State Voter Registration.  It allows viewing this data, comparing the data against a prescribed PDF document printed from LCR (see below), and exporting an Excel spreadsheet containing the output of the comparison.
